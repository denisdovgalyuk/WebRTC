# WebRTC

## Description

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free, open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with
real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). It allows audio and video
communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install
plugins or download native apps. Supported by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Opera, WebRTC specifications have
been published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
